# ðŸ“¦ My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website project built as a modern Single Page Application (SPA) using **React**, **Vite**, and **Material-UI (MUI)**.

The project follows production-grade standards with a strong emphasis on clean code structure, full separation of components, styles, and logic, and a clear folder architecture based on responsibilities.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Principles

- **Modular Structure:**  Each component lives in its own folder with separate style files, making the codebase easy to scale and maintain.

- **Clean Separation:**  Logic and styling are kept apart using CSS-in-JS (Styled Components, MUI), ensuring clarity and reusability.

- **Responsive Design:**  Optimized for all screen sizes with a mobile-first approach and smooth UX across devices.

- **Modern Code Standards:**  Built using React hooks, consistent naming, and best practices from React and MUI ecosystems.

- **Production-Ready:** Fully structured for deployment, including organized folders, config management, and clear separation of concerns.

- **EmailJS Integration:** Contact form is powered by EmailJS, allowing users to send messages without a backend.

This project is great for developers looking to present their work professionally or learn how to build a real-world SPA.
